Inspired by [this](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til/blob/master/README.md), I decided to keep a Today I Learned (TIL) page.

-------------------------
Books
* [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/books)
"Some books can be freely read and downloaded. Others can be borrowed and read in our online book reader."

Mac
* Mouse Keys ([source](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/control-the-pointer-using-mouse-keys-mh27469/mac))

You can control the pointer using keys.
1. Press Option + Command + F5 to launch Accessibility Options.
2. Select Mouse Keys.
When Mouse Keys are turned on, the 7, 8, 9, u, o, j, k, and l keys are repurposed to move the pointer (the mouse pointer) rather than their normal function.
    
> Sidenote: I discovered this feature after lending my Mac to someone. 
Shortly after lending it, I was notified that the right side of the keyboard "no longer worked." 
At first we had assumed something was wrong with the keyboard until we realized these keys worked normally during login...
